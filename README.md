Disclaimer & Licensing:

Eventually I will note here that all code without a license present in the file, or otherwise expressed in this readme or other license.txt files in this repository will be given permission under the MIT license. Currently, however, this is just a dump of stuff that I have not sorted through, so for now you'll have to assume any files is licensed elsewhere or is copyright of Steve Tranby.

* A few files are curtesy of other projects which I will eventually link to here.
** Some of the code in this repository is inspired by code found online. I will eventually document where the code came from. In some cases I may have written code without knowledge of other code that is similar or [nearly] identical.
*** Again, I will update this once I sort everything out.
